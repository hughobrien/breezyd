# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Build, test, lint

```sh
make build       # go build -> ./breezyd ./breezy
make test        # go test -race ./...
make lint        # go vet ./...
make tidy        # go mod tidy
```

Race tests need cgo. On this dev host the default `gcc` lacks the TSan runtime; use clang:

```sh
CGO_ENABLED=1 CC=clang go test -race ./...
```

Run a single package or test:

```sh
go test ./pkg/breezy/...
go test ./cmd/breezyd -run TestPoller_FanSettle
```

Live integration tests are double-gated and require real hardware. They are skipped unless **both** the `integration` build tag and `BREEZY_INTEGRATION=1` are set, plus the three target env vars:

```sh
BREEZY_INTEGRATION=1 \
BREEZY_TEST_DEVICE_IP=... BREEZY_TEST_DEVICE_ID=... BREEZY_TEST_DEVICE_PASSWORD=... \
go test -tags integration ./pkg/breezy/...
```

These tests write to the device. Each one registers a `t.Cleanup` that restores the prior value, so re-runs leave state intact. **Never remove or weaken those cleanups** — see the project rule about not making unsanctioned writes to user hardware.

Nix flake builds work too: `nix build`, `nix develop`, `nix run .#breezy -- ls`. The flake's `vendorHash` in `flake.nix` must be updated whenever `go.sum` changes.

## Architecture

Three artefacts from one Go module (`github.com/hughobrien/breezyd`):

1. **`pkg/breezy`** — importable protocol library. Speaks the Vents Twinfresh FDFD/02 framed protocol over UDP/4000.
2. **`cmd/breezyd`** — long-running daemon. Owns *all* UDP traffic, polls every configured device, caches snapshots, exposes JSON HTTP + Prometheus `/metrics`.
3. **`cmd/breezy`** — thin CLI. Talks HTTP to the daemon for everything except `breezy discover`, which broadcasts on the LAN directly.

`internal/config` is the shared TOML loader. `pkg/breezy/fakedevice` is an in-process UDP server that replays a captured snapshot — every non-integration test runs against it.

### Why a daemon owns UDP

Concurrent UDP request/response with checksums isn't safe to fan out from independent CLI invocations: overlapping retries and packet collisions cause silent corruption. `breezyd` serialises traffic per device behind a `sync.Mutex` in `pkg/breezy.Client` and a single per-device poller goroutine. The CLI never opens a UDP socket (except `discover`).

### Cache vs. passthrough

- `GET /v1/devices`, `GET /v1/devices/{name}`, `/metrics` → in-memory cache populated by the poller. Reads are cheap and never block on UDP.
- `GET /v1/devices/{name}/params/{id}` → bypasses cache, always issues a fresh UDP read. Use for debugging.
- All writes (`POST /v1/devices/{name}/...`) hit UDP and update the cache on success.

### Fan-settle window (a real protocol quirk)

After a write to `0x02` (speed_mode), `0x44` (manual %), or `0xB7` (fan rotation), the unit takes 10–15s before `0x4A`/`0x4B` (fan RPMs) and `0x84` (air-quality status) reflect the new state. The poller suppresses reads of `fanSensitiveReads` for `fanSettleDuration = 12s` after any `fanWriteIDs` write. See `cmd/breezyd/poller.go`. **Don't shorten this window** — the protocol genuinely lies during that interval.

### Sensor override (a user-visible firmware quirk)

When humidity/CO2/VOC exceed thresholds and the matching sensor is enabled, the firmware boosts the fan above the user's setting. The status output distinguishes `configured` (what the user asked for) from `live` (what's actually happening), and the `⚠` line on `breezy <name> status` only fires when `live.in_user_control` is false. Preserve that distinction in any output changes.

## Protocol invariants (`pkg/breezy/frame.go`, `client.go`)

- Frame: `FD FD | TYPE(0x02) | SIZE_ID(0x10) | ID(16 ASCII) | SIZE_PWD | PWD | FUNC | DATA | Chksum_L | Chksum_H`. Checksum = sum of bytes from `TYPE` through end of `DATA`, low byte first.
- Function codes: `0x01` read, `0x02` write-no-response, `0x03` write-with-response, `0x04` increment, `0x05` decrement, `0x06` controller response, **`0x07` auth failure** (undocumented; surfaced as `ErrAuth`).
- Multi-byte values use `FE <size> <id> <bytes...>` framing inside DATA.
- Parameter IDs ≥ `0x0100` use `FF <hi>` page prefixing inside DATA.
- Discovery: a request with the literal device ID `DEFAULT_DEVICEID` returns the unit's true ID and unit type regardless of password. **Discovery is unauthenticated.**
- Time encodings are little-endian smaller-unit-first: 2-byte = `[min, hr]`, 3-byte = `[sec, min, hr]`, 4-byte = `[min, hr, day_lo, day_hi]`.

The vendor protocol manual (`docs/superpowers/specs/breezy-manual-vendor.pdf`) is the authoritative wire-protocol reference. The full per-parameter map (id → name, type, R/W, units, observed values) lives at `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-05-03-param-map.md`. **Read those before reverse-engineering anything new.**

## CLI surface

Subject-before-verb: `breezy <device-name> <verb> [args]`. Per-device verbs (`status`, `on`/`off`, `speed`, `mode`, `heater`, `reset-filter`, `reset-faults`, `faults`, `firmware`, `efficiency`, `rtc [set]`, `get <param>`, `set <param> <val>`) and globals (`ls`, `discover`, `daemon-url`).

Reserved global names cannot be used as device names — the config loader rejects collisions in `internal/config`.

CLI exit codes: `0` success, `1` daemon/HTTP error (with the daemon's `{"error","code"}` envelope rendered as `error: <msg> (<code>)`), `2` local usage error.

## Config

`~/.config/breezy/config.toml`, mode `0600` (loader refuses world-readable — passwords are stored cleartext, and the device leaks them anyway, so this is the floor). Same file is read by daemon and CLI; CLI only consumes `[daemon].listen`.

`discovery` is one of `"on-start"`, `"off"`, or `"periodic:<duration>"`.

## Spec & design docs

- `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-05-03-twinfresh-cli-design.md` — design doc covering protocol decisions, daemon architecture, error semantics, status-line format. The closest thing to a "why".
- `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-05-03-param-map.md` — every parameter ID with type, units, observed values.
- `docs/superpowers/specs/breezy-manual-vendor.pdf` — vendor protocol manual.
- `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-05-03-twinfresh-cli.md` — original implementation plan; matches the v1 scope shipped in 1.0.0.

## Out of scope (deliberate, not bugs)

No schedule editing, no WiFi reconfig, no MQTT bridge, no Home Assistant component, no web UI. The state cache is shaped so a bridge could be added without rewriting the core, but adding any of these is a v2 conversation, not a v1 fix.

## Release plumbing

- `goreleaser` builds cross-platform archives on tag pushes. Build metadata (`version`, `commit`, `date`) is injected via `-ldflags` into both binaries' `main` package. The Nix derivation deliberately omits `-X main.date=…` for reproducibility.
- `nix/module.nix` exposes a NixOS service with hardened systemd settings; inline `settings` end up in the world-readable Nix store, so production deployments must use `configFile` with sops-nix/agenix for real device passwords.
